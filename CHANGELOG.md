# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Native targeted duplicate-face removal for indexed polygon meshes, with cyclic face/corner correspondence and whole-request rejection.
- Preservation of all supported UV sets and variable skin influence rows; unsupported semantics block edits unless explicitly declared row-local.
- CMake installation and a separate installed consumer. No CLI, adapter, Python package or release yet.
